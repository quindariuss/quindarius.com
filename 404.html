	This is not the end of the world. 
	When I was a child, I often felt lost. 
	As man now, the feeling still lingers.

<blockquote>
I, too, sing America.<br>
<br>
I am the darker brother.<br>
They send me to eat in the kitchen<br>
When company comes,<br>
But I laugh,<br>
And eat well,<br>
And grow strong.                           <br>
<br>
Tomorrow,<br>
I'll be at the table<br>
When company comes.<br>
Nobody'll dare<br>
Say to me<br>
"Eat in the kitchen,"<br>
Then.<br>
<br>
Besides,<br>
They'll see how beautiful I am<br>
And be ashamed-<br>
<br>
I, too, am America.
