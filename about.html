<h2>
Computing Background
</h2>
<p>
Let us start from college on.
I was initially a nursing major.
For 3 and 1/2 semesters.
Loved it, the classes were great and I soaked up the material.
Then I purchased <em>my</em> first personal computer. 
</p>
<p>
Lets skip the honeymoon phase. 
Shortly after this I take Programming Principles to <em>see what its all about</em>.
It was extremely difficult because I have never seen ANYTHING like this.
But I continued and liked it enough to switch my major. 
Not a single class transferred. 
Worth it.

Currently
</h2>
<p>
I am a senior Computer Science student at Kennesaw State University.
I have taken classes for operating systems development, A.I., Natural Language Processing, Database Engineering, and so much more. 
I have gained lots of experience along the way as well.
I worked for Apple, <a href="articles/lavendale/lavendale.html">Lavendale</a>, <a href="articles/mindsense/mindsense.html">Mindsense</a>, and had some contract work along the way.
</p>
<p>
I like working and learning UNIX Systems.
My favorite language is C for its brutal simplicity, and because how versatile it is with systems programming. 
My language that makes me the most money is Swift.
My language that I use for the web is Javascript if I need to.
The language I use most is my shell if you count that :).
