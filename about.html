				Computing Background
			</h2>
			<p>
				Let us start from college on.
				I was initially a nursing major.
				For 3 and 1/2 semesters.
				Loved it, the classes were great and I soaked up the material.
				Then I purchased <em>my</em> first personal computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shortly after this, I take Programming Principles to try my hand at programming.
				It was extremely difficult because I have never seen ANYTHING like this.
				But I continued and liked it enough to switch my major.
				Not a single class transferred.
				Worth it.

				Currently
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am a senior Computer Science student at Kennesaw State University.
				I have taken classes for operating systems development, A.I., Natural Language Processing, Database Engineering, and so much more.
				I have gained lots of experience along the way as well.
				I worked for Apple, <a href="articles/lavendale/lavendale.html">Lavendale</a>, <a href="articles/mindsense/mindsense.html">Mindsense</a>, and had some contract work along the way.
				I currently work for Rekor as an iOS Developer making cool stuff with Machine Learning!
			</p>
			<p>
				I like working and learning <strike>UNIX</strike> UNIX-like Systems.
				My favorite language is C for its brutal simplicity, and because how versatile it is with systems programming.
				My language that makes me the most money is Swift.
				My language that I use for the web is Javascript if I need to.
				The language I use most is my shell if you count that :).
				Wow I really wanted to update this too but this still stands.
				I think I have a good thing going here.
