		<h2>I made an App</h2>
		
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes the future is something to look forward to. 
			Everyone has their reasons, so did my mom.
			So she like the other optimist in the room looked for a Countdown App.
			Something so basic you would like to think that it would be a built in app.
			Kinda is and kinda isn't, she wants to be fancy and have a name to the countdown. 
			Also have the: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Days
			</li>
			<li>
				Hours
			</li>
			<li>
				Minutes
			</li>
			<li>
				Seconds
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Listed out for her.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are plenty of apps that do the same functionality. 
			So why make another one? 
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			It's the <strike>economy</strike> ads stupid.
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Feature Creep</h3>
		<p>
			Boring Section Alert. 
			There was none. 
			I am doing the bare minimum so help me god.
			Literally just giving my loving caretaker what she asked for and nothing more. 
			Unless she asks.
			But until the we are KISS.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Keep
			It
			Simple
			Stupid
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Saving Data</h3>
		<p>
			I did add the ability to save the date and the title. 
			No I didn't use Core Data like a weirdo, just throw the items in UserDefaults. 
			Super nice to work with, going to be using it much more in the future.
		</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			The app is called Qountdown.
			Clever name right?
			Will be posting the links to the TestFlight and Appstore here soon.
