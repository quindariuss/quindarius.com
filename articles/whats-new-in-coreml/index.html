			Introduction
		</h3>
		<p>
			Hello, my name is Quin'darius Lyles-Woods and I am going to talk to you all about what's new in CoreML, Apples Machine Learning Toolkit.
			I am employed at Rekor, a company building intelligent infrastructure for cites and municipalities, working on their mobile application.
			Typically, outside of work,
			I am building things around the house,
			learning to play the piano,
			loving on the <strike>13</strike> 12 cats and 3 dogs in my house,
			or simply caught with a beer or a book.
			Otherwise in my spare time I will am building API's and taking Domains,
			only half joking.
		</p>
		<p>
			My history with machine learning did not start at with Apple's CoreML Framework, but I wish it did.
		</p>
		<p>
			My first time building intelligent agents was in my Artificial Intelligence class where,
			hold your breath,
			I built most of my agents in Javascript as web applications.
			Okay maybe that was as ground shattering of a thought as I think or thought it was.
			I would build applications that would do semi-intelligent things and run in the browser I thought that was kinda neat.
			After this course I took NLP, Natural Language Processing, where I learned tons more about Machine Learning. Eventually making a pretty great model for classification of bodies of political text. Later on my partner and I were invited to present the process of data collection and model creation at the National Council on Undergraduate Research.
		</p>
		<p>
			*fast forward* to <strong>NOW</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I am taking what I have learned and am learning into a practical arena at my job.
			Being a Machine Vision, 
			a subset of machine learning, 
			application there is always for something for you to improve on because. 
			Technically, the model result is never 100% accurate, 
			so the work never ends.
