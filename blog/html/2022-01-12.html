Went to chemisty class this morning and was going to go to lab but they were cancelled so that's pretty awesome.
With this extra time I am going to focus on getting the code for my interview well into my head.

Looking to make the networking for match my mechanic integrated with combine. 
I will take me a while but I think it will serve as a huge benfit during the interview.
I will probably use the playgrounds mode to test all of this before I implement it into the application.

Combine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of combines features are higher order functions on a collection of objects.

let array = [1,2,3].map{$0 * 2} 
print(array)

> [2, 4, 6]

Simplest Publisher and Sink imo 

[1, 2, 3]
    .sink { value in
        print("\(value)")
    }
            
> 1
> 2
> 3

Okay I just learned a bunch more but I don't want to change my code.
I feel like it would be putting a fake foot forward and I don't want to do it.
Somebody who does not have morals and googles about some magical code that encompasses all these things will probably get the job. 
At least I will know I put MY best foot forward.

A celebration needs people who have something to celebrate. 
A climax, a moment.
