Probability and Data Analysis is terribly boring.
This is entirely the professors fault.
He doesn't see if there are any questions and just drones on and on.
I think it is his sentence structure, using periodic type sentences.

I think I will just work on learning R during this time instead.

Talked to the professor about R. 
Really glad he agrees with me about the things I like about it.
Mainly because what can be implied about countless other questions.

Need to make sure to email him about getting those example datasets.
Done. 

Piano Practice is going well.
I have moved to the G position and doing very well in it.
I wonder when the music starts mixing the two positions and how I will fare. 

Almost done with American Yawp.
About ~3 more chapters left.
I will probably finish my current one if I don't gossip my time away.

I have also decided that I need a way to search my notes.
A simple cat all of them and then getting the grep of them would be great.
Or I can just grep the folder.
That's the one.

Also I want to USE OpenBSD.
Instead of just trying to be a developer first.
