--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When in doubt, use brute force.
> Ken Thompson

Reading the Art of Unix Programming and it is very insightful.
It advocates for fast development, and iterations.
This is better than stalling out in my opinion.

Unix Philosophy: 
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

I will finish The Art of Unix Programming in 15, one hour segments.
