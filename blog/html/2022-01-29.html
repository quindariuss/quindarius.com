I fear dying without having produced.
In the same thought the words of Ayn Rand comes to mind.

Your fear of death is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. 
Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not force him to perform. 
>Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand

Speaking to which, I have this fear but and understanding that it is worthless.
With this I need to work to learn to produce more and consume less.
Produce more than I consume. 
A noble goal, in this economy of thought.

I have finished chapter 22 in American Yawp. 
I am now into the Great Depression. 

Currently I am suck in the Alfred's Adult Piano book on Beautiful Brown Eyes.
Getting better but still pretty tough. 
Hard to believe it has only been a month of me practicing paino. 

Want to spend the rest of the day "ricing OpenBSD"
