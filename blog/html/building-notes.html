Rebuilding my website
================================================================================

Before, my website was programmed by hand and looked like this: 

website-image.png 

In my opinion the website looked great and if I found a site anywhere as good I would email the owner so fast but now I know that I must automate it.
Mainly for an appropriate blogging workflow. 
I like to type my notes out in plain text and its a hassle converting it into html. 
I want to automate it but in the current structure it doesn't seem likely. 
Too many involved parts, going into all the articles.

Easy enough right? 
Now I just need the text files for the blog converted into html files.

I just want the header and text in the site

This script works well.
#
cat head.html pre.html text/changing-brightness.txt ppre.html > test.html
#

Now I need to do it for the whole directory which should'nt be that bad.

blog generator works.
I want to add a title to all the post so I will do that as well with the date.

Blog Post Generator
    What makes the actual post
Blog Page Generator
    What makes the links to the post

Everything else can be hand done for now.

Gotta test the links generator
Everything works!
Now I really want to clean up let me write the steps that I need for this blog engine

daily notes
|
+--> blog-page.sh
     |_links.html
       |
       +---> combined to page(should just put this in the script)
     


Theory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I love how Octavia Butlers books read.
They are made like a blog actually check it out if you get a chance.
One of the things that I haven't looked into was the main character blogged everyday.
I want to be like the main character in her book Parable of the Sower.
So that is why building out the blog is super important.
