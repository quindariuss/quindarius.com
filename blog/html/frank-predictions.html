Frank Predictions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the book words that work, Frank Luntz outlines some major words or phrases that should never be said and what should be said instead. I this post I will analyze the basis of this and weather the usage of such words and phrases to have actually been lowered. 

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Ian Luntz is an American political and communications consultant, pollster, and pundit, best known for developing talking points and other messaging for Republican causes.
Well at least that is what Wikipedia says.
How I think of Luntz is as an applied linguist, for better and for worse. 
He compiles information from his case studies of language use and gives the results of such studies to paying individuals in an actionable context. 

Towards the end of his book "Words that Work", Luntz describes -The 21 Political Words and Phrases You Should Never Say Again-. 
He claims that one must stop using these words to effectively educate the readers as media outlets.

List of Words and Phrases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never Say                 |   Instead Say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Privatization             |-> Personalization

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I excluded about 2 or three of them because it would be awkward getting insight into those phrases.

Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Data
I already have the data from a school research project compiling a years worth of information from Fox and CNN so those will be the stations that I will reporting on.  
The data consists of ~28,000 articles. 
All of the data is from the politics sections which lends well to Frank Luntz's Analysis.
- Processing Tools
I will not go into how I got the data for the article but for the text processing I will be using on those files I think all I will need is grep. 
-- grep 
file pattern searcher
--- grep -r
Recursively search subdirectories listed.
--- grep -c
Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.

Both of these folders have ~16,000 articles each.
While I will not show the computations for each of these terms after seeing two examples you will get the idea.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To tell you the truth I got lazy and optimized. 

I used this script to run all the phrases for me. 

################################################################################
for index in {1..24};
	do echo
	"$(head -n $index never| tail -n 1)($(cat cnn/* |
	grep -c "$(head -n $index never| tail -n 1)"))";
done
################################################################################

The 'never' file is just the contents of the never side of the list, nothing more.
I do the same thing to get the instead column.
After this script was written I decided it was pretty easy to check on how fox does. 
All that was done was change the #cat cnn/*# to #cat fox/*#.

Conclusions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have some final questions for this data. 
Do the words chosen by Luntz actually educate the reader more?
Do these words promote actually the opposite of what he is claiming? 
Are the results of the words not being used a hit to Luntz or Fox/CNN credit?

My answers to those questions are as follows.
No I do not think that the majority of the words that Luntz chooses are to educate the reader but rather to paciest them.
Land a blow that doesn't live in the mental but in the subconscious. 
To the question of whose fault the current state of the media is in, I do not believe that this state is his doing, he is not the actor to promote systematic change within the trade of language but to his credit he can flip a script for a given group or organization.
