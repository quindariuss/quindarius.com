Piano practice is going pretty well. 
I am at page 33 currently. 
I feel confident with the C position and being to rely on reading the sheet music a lot more. 
Also, practice felt more fun than struggle today so that is a plus. 
Funny how you have to suffer a little bit before the rewards come in.

Closing up on the end of the day.
I was in the library earlier today pursing the sections.
I landed upon the American history section.
Recently, I have finished reading up to chapter two in American Yawp.
Coming off of that knowledge I had a better appreciation for that section.
My eye caught the book Blacks in Canada for couple of reasons.
Mainly because I do not know a lot about Canadian history.
After reading, I learned that Canada's history is much like ours.
Here's a diagram to illustrate:

Americans Colonization
|_North America   -> France        -> Canada
|_Central America -> Great Britain -> America 
|_South America   -> Spain         -> Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Peru Etc. 

Within the book, Blacks in Canada, they talk about a small black boy.
That was my french translation. 
Apparently he was the first Black man/Slave in Canada given as a gift.
