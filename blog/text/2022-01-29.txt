I fear dying without having produced.
In the same thought the words of Ayn Rand comes to mind.

Your fear of death is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. 
Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not force him to perform. 
>Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand

Speaking to which, I have this fear but and understanding that it is worthless.
With this I need to work to learn to produce more and consume less.
Produce more than I consume. 
A noble goal, in this economy of thought.

I have finished chapter 22 in American Yawp. 
I am now into the Great Depression. 

Currently I am suck in the Alfred's Adult Piano book on Beautiful Brown Eyes.
Getting better but still pretty tough. 
Hard to believe it has only been a month of me practicing paino. 

Want to spend the rest of the day "ricing OpenBSD"

Installing a font: 
Move into the ~/.font directory
run fc-cache

List fonts:
fc-list


Website: Books 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I understand how my book page is going to work. 
Well not totally. 
But I now understand that I will be basically making a compiler for my books. 
I will have to keep a folder with my books information.
Making a system for a script to find things might make it easy for me to post them as well. 

Rough Draft: 
Books(folder)
|
+-->Author(folder)
   |
   +-->Book(folder)
      |
      +-->Meta Information(file)
      |
      +-->Notes(file)
      |
      +-->Quotes(file)
      |
      +-->Formats(folder)
          |
          +-->Text
          |
          +-->PDF
          |
          +-->LaTeX

My music folder will follow the same design 

Music(folder)
|
+-->Artist(folder)
    |
    +-->Songs(folder)
    |
    +-->Sheet Music(folder)
    |
    +-->Albums(folder)
        |
        +-->Albums(folder)

It would make sense that my software should follow the same design. 

Software(folder)
|
+-->Author(folder)
    |
    +-->Project(folder)
        |
        +-->Source(folder)
        |
        +-->Binaries(folder)

While I am here I should think of a way to organize my photos. 

Photos
|
+-->Year(folder)
    |
    +-->Month(folder)
        |
        +-->Day(folder)
            |
            +-->Photo(file)
            |
            +-->Notes(file)

There is another Folder I need to make but do not know how to make it. 
A reference folder. 
Almost like an offline Wikipedia that I can search. 
Maybe even lots of collected data.
I will do my best. 

Reference(folder)
|
+-->Subject(folder)
    |
    +-->Topic(folder)

Yeah after that everything will get really circular
