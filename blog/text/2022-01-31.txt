Feeling a little aloof today. 
I woke up at 0600 and got my dog, Octavia, on the bed. 
We laid there until 0730. 
I should have been up at 0630 to start my day.
Well spent but at the same time I need more self control with that.

Was able to get my reading and piano practice in. 
Probably a hour for reading and 30 mins for piano practice.

Meet with my physics professor today as well. 
That was brutal but it had to be done. 
All I need is a D in the class so I am not worried. 
So without that worry I want to really try to understand all of this stuff. 
We spent about an hour talking about the homework. 
Summary of the points: 
F = qE 
F = mG
qE = mG
charge * Electric Field = mass * Gravity
sorta 

((ke * Q)/r^2)(Vector R)

ke * Q 
------ (R)
  r^2

Cool I was worried I did not write in my blog today. 
Funny thing, after like 5pm I started feeling really great and mentally there. 
Before, the day was really dragging on. 

Metal is a cheaper building material than wood. 
$40,000 for like 2400sq building frame. 
That is really nice. 
I would do that in a heartbeat. 

Mentored Dallin Foskey today. 
We started with learning web programming.
So HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
We only got to html. 
What took so long was getting the Github account set up.
Not only on their website but on his computer. 
Alas, it was done and a lot of the pain of getting into programming is done.
Now my plan is to get him familiar with making websites.
From there he will go far, very far.
