To add metadata to music, you can use ffmpeg. 
Example: 
ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -metadata album_artist='stack developer' -y -r 1 -acodec copy -vcodec copy destination.mp4

Great website showing how to add metadata with ffmpeg

Great quote by Evan Miller about learning computers and cars. 
He relates it to any skill.

The view from the top is nice, but if you aspire to climb mountains, thereâ€™s no better place to start than at the bottom.
