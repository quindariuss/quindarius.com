Remaking my physics homework in latex so I can use it on my reMarkable notepad.
Looks great and will be awesome for having the professor work through the problems with me. 
I would like to see the solutions uploaded so other students can see the solution worked out after the due date has passed.

Getting ready for a meeting with Ben at Rekor.
I received a pretty weird email saying he has a few more questions. 
Nervous? 
An understatement. 

Getting the Job: 
Pros: 
Get to work with Rick. 
Get to build cool things and code all day. 
Get to get PAID to code all day.(surreal) 
Get tons of mentoring and become a better programmer. 
Get to lighten my school workload. 

Cons: 
Will miss my physics professor

Well we got the job! 
I will miss my physic professor,Nicolas Douguet. 
The position is for $80,000 base. 
Should be enough to fund my future plans. 
Gotta stay focused and do the best work I can. 

I want to reread Fernando's book again. 
It is on Gumroad so I will check it out on my kindle.

I would like to automate the book part of my website. 
So all the books I have in my books directory will be uploaded to my site.
Along with the formats that I have it in. 

Kinda disappointed not to hear a congratulations for getting my job.
Only: 
"You better finish school." 
Doesn't make sense to me. 
I have paid for my college in cash about ~ $40,000.
So I have been the one bearing the cost.
I will be in school even when it is not required of me. 
Maybe I am thinking into their head too much. 
This is not totally isolated. 
I got on the Dean's List once and told them and there was no reaction. 
Well no enough to satisfy my reaction. 
I guess when the fruits of my labor pay off and I excited they are not to the extent that I am. 
This is good I was not sure whether to right this in my notes but my hope is that it will just be drowned out over time.
Somebody will have to go through some work to find this and if they do, They have earned it. 

Anyways I am super excited.
I want to start getting ready for a house soon. 
There is so much I need to learn.
