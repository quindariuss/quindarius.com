App idea
Calendar with events and task

Theory
Okay so the calendar will be specific for one person
Someone can only be at one place at one time
Someone can techincally only do one event at one time
Example 
Someone is at work and work lasts for 8 hours. 
You have a break at work. 
You have task to do at work. 

The Calendar would look something like this: 
0000 : Sleep
0800 : Sleep
0900 : Work
1000 : *Meeting
1200 : Meeting
1300 : Break 
1400 : Break
1500 :-> Finished a Task
1700 : Work

If an event has a child event it will become a file independent of the main days file.
The files name will be the date then the event name then the time. 

Calendar(folder)
|__History(File) 
|__Year(folder) 
   |__Time(file) 
   |__Notes(file) 
   |__Month(folder) 
      |__Time(file) 
      |__Notes(file) 
      |__Week(folder) 
         |__Time(file) 
         |__Notes(file) 
         |__Day(folder) 
            |__Time(file) 
            |__Notes(file) 

History File: 
Year: 
1997
    Month: 
    September
         Day: 
         14
            Time:
            2400:-> Born
                Was said to be a very cute boy.

Ideally these files will exist on a system like this: 
./Reference(folder)
|__People(folder)
   |__ Calendar(folder)
      |__History(File) 
      |__Year(folder) 
         |__Time(file) 
         |__Notes(file) 
         |__Month(folder) 
            |__Time(file) 
            |__Notes(file) 
            |__Week(folder) 
               |__Time(file) 
               |__Notes(file) 
               |__Day(folder) 
                  |__Time(file) 
                  |__Notes(file) 

People and calendars have to be together. 
The cool thing about this is I would want for people you know and don't know to be in the same folder. 
Like the presidents, actors, singer and the like. 
But only people you have thought about. 
You will be able to link the files you have across your desktop with the links. 
So lets say you have a photo of Marilyn Monroe from 1934. 
It will be added under the photos album and noted in the file such as.
~/Photos/1934/January/05/2400.jpg
