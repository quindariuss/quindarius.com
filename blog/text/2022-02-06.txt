----------
Learning qcad right now.
Stuff is pretty fun! 

Met with Jessie today. 
She was super cool and fun. 
We really hit it off in a platonic sort of way.
She even had her screen gray scaled too! 
She told me to read robert sandler. 
He is a kinda fantasy sort of writer. 
I feel like I came off as too academic and technical with my books.

Kinda of crazy but I think that is what I like. 
I can not help it, I would if I could. 

I think what I really learned from atlas shrugged is the value of money.
I think everyone can learn that from the book. 
It is hard for me to steal/pirate things that I want nowadays. 
Like yes it would be financial beneficial to do so. 
At the same time you are saying it is not worth you money.
So anything you pirate is a contradiction if you say its good.
Of course in your head its not. 
But you vote for value with your money. 
Where your money is spent is what matters to you to a great degree.


Got Dave and Jan's House plans and the cost of the 3 story house was $107,000.
$170,000 with labor. 
Not bad.

Cad software history is really cool.
Started with Ivan S. 
Was really good and cool and has kinda died down now.
I think the future of it is within the free/free but you can pay tools.
