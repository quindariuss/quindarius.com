Okay got to page 44 in the qcad book.
The book is 244 pages in total. 

After I awoke this morning I started reading.
I let Octavia sleep in the bed with me.
So when I woke up I wanted to cuddle with her.
To make my time useful I started reading and I really like that.
So now I have finished the American Yawp Volume One and Two. 
Next on my list is War and Peace. 

But first a quick review on the American Yawp: 
The book gave a really succinct overview of American History. 
I feel more confident within myself knowing the status of our country. 
I feel more confident within myself knowing what my country thinks of my skin.
I feel more confident within myself knowing what the Ronald Reagan shirts mean. 
What the confederate flag means. 
What the Nixon administration stood for. 
What and how the civil rights were won and lost. 
The victorious moments in America's history. 
The moment where notably bad there were silver linings.

Got the money for Match my Mechanic! 

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
