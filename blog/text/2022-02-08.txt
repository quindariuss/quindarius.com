Started War and Peace today. 
I don't know how to spell the authors name so I won't try. 
It is very good starting off. 
The book, I don't know where it is set to be honest.
Most of it is in french and I guess they did not want to do a full translation.
But it is talking about how the party quest are discussing the worlds events.
Mainly the events surrounding Russia and Napoleon Bonaparte.

Napoleon Bonaparte was a french political and military leader. 
He rose to power during the french revolution.

I learned about the Eames Chair. 
It looks very good, something that I will own one day.
I don't think I want to get a 'real' one. 
Reason being, it is not produced by the 'real' inventor anymore.
So any knockoff should be just the same and just as good.
The cost is about $700 a chair which is okay.
I will buy two and have them in my living room. 
Both black and some kind of bright orange cherry wood.

I really want to get the book automation going. 

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9780307806581

This allows you to use a link to the book by isbn will help getting the meta data in the file. 

In the meta I don't want too much just: 
Title
Subtitle
Author
Page Count

All I have to do is get that JSON response from this api and pulling those object from the JSON.

Might be able to finish this while I am with Kelsey tonight.
