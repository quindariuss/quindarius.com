Today I had a meeting with Katherine Mooney and others.
Mainly about benefits. 
Talked to rick for a good bit as well after that meeting. 

Got my email but it was a little mangled. 
They misspelt it as so: 
lwoods@rekor.ai
Not a big deal. 

Right now I do not know what I should be doing but I will be just reading the code until I meet with rick again. 
Have not been given any task yet. 

Updated the company documentation.
It had myhc.com when it should have been myuhc.com

I would also like to make documentation for what to do when uploading the application via Apple Store Connect. 

To install Xcode and generally a script to get a work environment set up.

First Download from this site the latest version that is not a Beta
https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode

I don't think you need to install the command line tools but to switch where the tools are. 
I will have to test this on the new computer. 
But you should be able to check it with Xcode-select
and you can also switch Xcode tools with this as well.
