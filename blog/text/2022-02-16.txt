Would like to work on getting the scanning interface fixed because it seems to be blocking a ton of items.

Meeting with Rick: 
    Apple rejected us:
        Unresolved issues:
            App Completeness:
                Expired demo account: 
                    
When an application is rejected: 

Make sure you have the correct permissions to resolve the issue: 
Permissions: 
Admin 
App Manager
Read the message thoroughly and respond to confirm the issue if necessary. 

View in databases 
A link to a query 

Rick talked about integrating chat into the application.
I am going to check out stream io today 
Both seem terrible and I don't know why we don't just hack our own chat :). 

The worst of the two evils at the moment in my head looks to be getstream

mainly because the code for all the example stuff was written in storyboard. 
Yikes.

Working on the camera rotation fix: 
Why is the scan view being called before the app fully loads? 
Opening up the view hierarchay to see if I can find a better solution.
The no reads yet is in a very bad position. 
Need to off set that to the other side just like the maps view. 
It is not the overlay.
I am thinking its the way the UIImage is decleared
That has changed nothing adding .resizableUIImage
Everything to change this camera orientation will happen within the Cammera Wrapper

We got the camera flipped!

This is the code that gets me the moved camera orientation. 

--------------------
class CameraView: UIView
{
  override class var layerClass: AnyClass { AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.self }
    var anothervideoPreview = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer()
    var videoPreviewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer { layer as! AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer }
  var session: AVCaptureSession? { videoPreviewLayer.session }
  init(frame: CGRect = .zero, session: AVCaptureSession) {
    super.init(frame: frame)
    videoPreviewLayer.session = session
      do
      {
      try
      self.videoPreviewLayer.connection?.setVideoOrientation(.landscapeRight)
      }
      catch
      {
          print("hello")
      }
    session.startRunning()
  }

  required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
    super.init(coder: coder)
  }
}
--------------------

Going to be working more with AVCapture tonight to play around. 


Late night notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a camera application off of Yono Mittlefehldt
https://www.raywenderlich.com/26244793-building-a-camera-app-with-swiftui-and-combine

- create a file for the frame view

What is conditionally unwrap? 
I think it means that you cover all the options when you cover each case.

If there is no bounding to the geometery reader the image will only fill what the bounds of the image instead of the screen. 
This could be why it does not fill in our current version now. 

CGImage
A bitmap image or image mask.

 - create a conditional image and unwrap it by saying what the picture would be if it existed and what it would be if it is null.


- create a file call CameraManager

What is a singleton? 

I am stoping for the night. 
will continue this tomorrow.
