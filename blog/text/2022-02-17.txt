Found out that my email is working it is Atlassian that is the problem. 
Turns out they might have but the email on a suppression list. 
This will make sure the company does not spend any emails to that email.
I have filed a ticket with them to get the issue resolved. 

I will continue to work on my progress from yesterday. 

The main issues with this that I am working on are these:

Okay so you declare a capture session then you add the inputs and outputs to the session

AVCaptureSession

Creation of a AV Session
------------------------
let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()

guard let audioDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .audio) else { return }

do {
    let audioInput = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: audioDevice)
    if captureSession.canAddInput(audioInput) {
        captureSession.addInput(audioInput)
    }
} catch {
    print("error")
}
