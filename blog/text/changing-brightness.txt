Changing Brightness 

Note to self. 

To change the brightness on Arch Linux you just the need to write to the brightness file.

On my particular setup this file is located at: /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness 

Another thing that I might need is the brightness of the colors to be changed as well. This is set by the following command. 

xrandr --output eDP --brightness 1.2
