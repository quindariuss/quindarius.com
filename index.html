				<strike>About the Blog</strike>
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am getting rid of the blog.
				When you are writing for a blog there is an admirable thought,
				you think you will write only what's on your mind.
				When writing knowing I am going to be publishing it,
				I could not help but thinking of the reader.
				When I sit down to write I would like the thoughts to be my own.
				Without the push to say certain things one way or another.
			</p>

			<h2>
				About the Articles
			</h2>
			<p>
				For non plain text post.
				You will see projects here.
				You will see <strike>Rants</strike> Research and Discussion with Receipts.
				You will see writings that take more than 30 minutes to read.
			</p>
			<p>
				The flow will go like this.
				I will write about something in my blog more than once.
				After a while I collect that information to make an article post.
				Will be an organic process, don't want to scare myself off.
			</p>

			<h2>
				About the Books
			</h2>
			<p>
				I like to read.
				It is probably a compulsive habit now.
				So this is a place to organize all of my books that I read.
				Along with the notes I take along the way.
				Most of these books I have in a high quality digital format.
				By that I mean I purchased them.
				So if for some reason you want a book and don't want to spend the cash email me I will let you <strike>have</strike> digitally borrow it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also like the process of typesetting.
				I don't know what it is about it but it makes me feel good.
				There are some older books that haven't been brought to the digital age.
				I am typesetting them in my spare time to bring them back to life.
				Mainly for my remarkable tablet and kindle.
				Be on the lookout for those files if you want them!
			</p>

			<h2>
				About the About :)
			</h2>
			<p>
				I tell you a little about myself but not too much because I am biased.
				You will have to read my blog to figure out how bad I am.
				All my contact information is there.
