	Root Evil	
</h2>
<h6 style="text-align:center">
One of my favorite speeches on money. 
It is a thought process that I am still working on internalizing because I too have used money as a method of correcting personal insecurities instead of working on them directly.
The view of money here is in my eyes is romantic or maybe I view it that way because its something yet to be achieved. 
Alas, enjoy.

			Social Freedom	
		</h2>
<h6 style="text-align:center">
			The process of going on to social media used to be amazing. 
			You are given a list of everything that your "friends" posted if you haven't spammed up your digital life with too many people you did not know. 
			You were not introduced with a billion different ideas form a billion different people. 
			A billion different ideas are not bad but the way we are receiving them are.

			Re-writing my website, with some seemingly bold aspirations.
			There are many things I want to express and have been looking for the correct medium, but now it's clear that the medium isn't found but created.
