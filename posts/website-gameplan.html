<h2>
	Website Gameplan
</h2> 
<p>
	Re-writing my website, with some seemingly bold aspirations.
	There are many things I want to express and have been looking for the correct medium, but now it's clear that the medium isn't found but created.

</p>
<h3>
	Design
</h3>
<p>
The website will be centered around text. 
That does not mean that there will be no images or videos but on the main page you will only see text.
The website should feel like reading a book. 
</p>
<h3>
	Function
</h3>
<p>
The way that the website will function is going to be as simple as possible.
When I say simple I mean S-I-M-P-L-E.
Lets define what is meant by simple.
Simple as in its understandable. 
Simple as in its portable.
Simple as in its something that I could recreate.
It will not be run by any pre-built static blog maker of sorts. 
But there will be programs that I write from scratch to make it easier to convert articles into HTML,RSS, and possibly PDF formats for longer articles.  
So this means all the articles will be written in a plain text file.
After the article has been written I am thinking of having meta data generated by git or other file statistics.
</p>
<h3>
	Theory
</h3>
<p>
Okay but why? 
Software is just an algorithm.
An algorithm is just a series of steps.
Steps are just decisions made. 
I want to make my own decisions where I can.
It is not necessary to make my own decisions in this respect and in a myriad of other areas in life as well.
But there is a feeling that I must do my best to make these decisions because what do I become if do not.
More so what am I reduced to if my decisions are made for me. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I simply need to work on my writing. 
Figured a website might be a great place to do that. 
Lots of other ideas I have about this website but I will have to hold them for later.
