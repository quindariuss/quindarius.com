Starting Services

Sometimes you need to keep that terrible python server have built from my last post running. 
Or you have a better built server and you want to get it up an going. 
Let me introduce you to the world of services!

$ man systemctl
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEMCTL(1)                     systemctl                    SYSTEMCTL(1)

NAME
       systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager
.
.
.

This is a tool on linux destops to help you manage your services. 

Service
    A program that runs in the background outside of the interactive control of system users. 

Useful for running things like api's. 

Steps: 
    Go to folder with all the services: 
    $ cd /etc/systemd/system

    Make a file with your service, mine will be an 'api'
    $ vim api.service

    Write your service file

    api.service

    [Unit]
    Description=API for Senior Project
    
    [Service]
    User=root
    WorkingDirectory=/root/api
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/flask --app main run --host=0.0.0.0
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

    Then reload the dameon
    $  systemctl daemon-reload

    Start the service
    $  systemctl start api.service

    Check if it is active
    $  systemctl status api.service
