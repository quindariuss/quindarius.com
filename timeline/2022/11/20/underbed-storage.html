				I built a box!
				This box also has wheels,
				and is approximately 3ft width,
				4ft length,
				1ft height.

				I looked forward to just buying this on amazon,
				but could not find something that fitted my needs.

				So here are my design documents.

		<h3>
			Design
		</h3>
		<p>
			I woke up Saturday morning craving for this project to be done.
			I sketched out this plan days before and now I knew I just needed to CAD(Computer Aided Design) it out.
			This is to get a rough cut list that I would need.
		</p>
		<p>
			After doing this I was able to come away with this lovely render.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course not all plans follow through.
			Not because we could not complete them,
			but because they are over-engineered.
			I this case particularly,
			I did not need the side 3in blocks at all.
			The plywood was a good enough brace.
		</p>

		<h3>
			In Hindsight
		</h3>
		<p>
			A couple of things I would do differently.
		</p>
		<p>
			With more patience,
			I would have loved to do miter cuts for the joinery.
			The butt joints were easy but the miters would have been sexy and strong.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use a skill saw for long cuts deeper than 12" into 4'x8' plywood.
		</p>
		<p>
			Draw out the cuts on the plywood before hand.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Cost
		</h4>
		<p>
			Everything was about $100 USD.
